## 9.2 Desktop Gateway

### 9.2.1 MeshChatX Local Service Port

The desktop MeshChatX application uses the dedicated loopback port
`https://127.0.0.1:18000` for its native backend and local web UI. This port is
separate from the ALWAYS ON mapping service listener on `127.0.0.1:8000`.

| Service | Domain | Listener | Exposure | Ownership |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MeshChatX native backend / web UI | Field / Reticulum | `https://127.0.0.1:18000` | Loopback only | `scottw` user service |
| WebODM web service | Mapping / `ao-mapping` | `127.0.0.1:8000` — **loopback only** | Loopback only; LAN addresses refuse and `ao-mapping` remains `Internal=true`. The UI opens directly at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` without an SSH tunnel | `ao-webodm-web.container` |
| Reticulum transport | Field / Reticulum | Reticulum-configured interfaces | No HTTP listener | Embedded MeshChatX backend |
| Mastodon local UI proxy | Sales / local operator access | `https://127.0.0.1:3300` — **loopback only, self-signed TLS** | Loopback only; LAN addresses refuse | `scottw` user service (`mastodon-local-proxy.service`) |

MeshChatX uses its self-signed local certificate; clients must use HTTPS and accept it. The
MeshChatX port is not a public ingress and must not be published through Podman, nginx,
Cloudflare or a router. WebODM and MeshChatX must not share a listener, and the desktop
launcher and watchdog must both use port `18000` — changing one without the others is a
configuration error.

The Mastodon local UI proxy on `https://127.0.0.1:3300` also uses a self-signed certificate
and the same acceptance applies. It is loopback-only and not a public ingress.

It exists because upstream Mastodon hardcodes `config.force_ssl = true` and
`https = Rails.env.production?`, neither switchable by environment variable, so Rails always
emits absolute `https://` asset URLs. Over plain HTTP the browser's request for a
render-blocking stylesheet never completes and the page hangs, even though every URL answers
curl in milliseconds. The proxy terminates TLS on loopback and injects
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. `mastodon-web` itself is unmodified, and federation through the
Cloudflare Tunnel is unaffected.

**The certificate is pre-trusted — there is no warning to click through.** It is
installed as a trusted CA (`CT,C,C`) in both `~/.pki/nssdb` (shared NSS store)
and the snap Firefox profile's `cert9.db`. Re-import with:

```bash
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -n "ALWAYS ON local Mastodon" \
  -t "CT,C,C" -i /ALWAYSON/secrets/mastodon/mastodon-local.crt
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/<profile> \
  -A -n "ALWAYS ON local Mastodon" -t "CT,C,C" \
  -i /ALWAYSON/secrets/mastodon/mastodon-local.crt
```

Firefox must be **closed** before its `cert9.db` is modified. Regenerating the
certificate requires repeating both commands.

The host uses two separate raw-LoRa/Reticulum interfaces. This is the single table for both.

| Radio | Hardware | Configured band | Operational state | Remaining observation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `PEOPLE-RADIO` | Heltec LoRa 32 V3, SX1262, RNode firmware 1.85 | 915 MHz | Functional | Characterize feedback observed on this band |
| `DRONE-RADIO` | Heltec LoRa 32 V3, SX1262, RNode firmware 1.85 | 917 MHz | Functional | Characterize feedback observed on this band |

Both RNodes initialize successfully in the active MeshChatX process, confirming device
detection, serial access, and RNode configuration. RF feedback is observable on both bands.

Bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, transmit power, and mode are recorded only in the
version-controlled US915 radio profiles in §9.4, not in this README. The two frequencies and
airtimes intentionally separate the public radio from the private drone radio; they must not be
treated as interchangeable or combined into one RF channel without an approved frequency plan.

Host configuration lives under `/home/scottw/.reticulum/`; MeshChatX runs headlessly at
`127.0.0.1:18000` with its Reticulum runtime initialized from `/home/scottw/.reticulum/config`,
and MeshChatX identity, repository, and application state under
`/home/scottw/.reticulum-meshchatx/`.

“Feedback” is an operator observation, not a diagnosed fault. Candidate categories are
self-feedback, nearby RF activity, interference, harmonics, spurious transmission, antenna
coupling, and reflected energy. Do not change power, frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor,
coding rate, antenna, or transmit mode until the source and severity are measured.

Both CP2102 bridges expose the same USB serial descriptor
`Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0001`, so device identity must be resolved
through the stable PCI/USB `by-path` location and the recorded SX1262 MAC address. The USB
serial descriptor alone is not a unique radio identity.

### 9.2.2 What each radio is for

The two radios are not interchangeable and are not both "chat". Each has one job:

| Radio | Purpose | Ties to | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PEOPLE-RADIO** (915 MHz / 125 kHz / SF7 / 17 dBm) | **LoRaWAN-related communication** — public human chat | **MeshChatX** | Carries MeshChatX text over LoRa into the local chat service. This radio is the LoRaWAN path for human conversation. |
| **DRONE-RADIO** (917 MHz / 250 kHz / SF7, hidden) | **Local QGroundControl missions** to the drone, over a **dedicated RNS-enabled connection** | **QGroundControl** | Carries a dedicated RNS-enabled QGC link to the **QGC session on the Raspberry Pi 5 drone**, so **missions can be updated midflight**. Radio only: no IP path, no mTLS. |

`QGroundControl` therefore has two roles: it plans and watches missions from the desktop,
and it receives **midflight mission updates** relayed by DRONE-RADIO to its session on the
Pi5. PEOPLE-RADIO has no relationship to the drone.

## 9.3 Operational Security

The MeshChatX web interface is restricted to `127.0.0.1:18000`.

The Reticulum `Public Gateway` listens on `0.0.0.0:4242` and is **deliberately
LAN-reachable**: the mesh protocol is intended to be reachable by peers.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Listener | `0.0.0.0:4242` — all IPv4 interfaces, not loopback-restricted |
| Host address | `192.168.87.135/24` on `wlp3s0` |
| UFW rule | `4242/tcp ALLOW Anywhere` — an explicit allow, not a default |
| Reachability test | connecting to `192.168.87.135:4242` **succeeds** |
| Web UI | `127.0.0.1:18000` only; `192.168.87.135:18000` correctly refused |

So `:4242` is reachable from the local network by design. This is **not** a finding against
the isolation model, which governs `ao-*` workloads: Reticulum and MeshChatX are separate
host tooling. It does mean that a loopback-only web UI does not make the underlying gateway
private, and anyone auditing exposure should expect `:4242` to be visible on the LAN. For
contrast, PostgreSQL is explicitly `5432/tcp DENY` from any non-loopback source, and KDE
Connect `:1716` is denied too.

## 9.4 Radio Profile Requirements

Each radio is defined by exactly one version-controlled profile. **The profile is the
specification** — this section states how a profile is accepted, not what fields it contains.

| Profile | Radio |
|---|---|
| `config/field/heltec-v3/radio-profile-us915.yaml` | `PEOPLE-RADIO` (Heltec V3) |
| `config/drone/waveshare-lora/radio-profile-us915.yaml` | `DRONE-RADIO` (Waveshare SX1262) |

**A profile is accepted only when all of the following hold.** These are testable conditions;
any one failing rejects the profile rather than falling back to a default.

| Condition | Test |
|---|---|
| Region and frequency plan are US915 | `region: US915`; the plan matches an approved entry in `config/platform/listener-allowlist.yaml` |
| The two radios cannot be confused on air | Different frequency, different sync word, different encryption key ID, different device identity |
| Radio parameters interoperate | Bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate and preamble match across both profiles, or the difference is recorded in the profile as intentional |
| Transmit power is legal | At or below the US915 ceiling for the band |
| Packet fits one airtime window | `max_packet_bytes` is deliverable at the profile's bandwidth and spreading factor within `airtime_limit_pct` |
| Device identity is unique | Not derived from the USB serial descriptor, which both CP2102 bridges share (§9.2.1) |
| Retry and replay are bounded | Retry count and backoff are both set; the sequence window is stated |

Matching SX1262-family chips do not guarantee protocol compatibility, so acceptance is by these
conditions and not by chip family. Both radio ends must be verified as US915 hardware variants
before use.

**This system is not LoRaWAN.** The field implementation is an RNode-based Reticulum mesh, and
it must not be described as LoRaWAN anywhere unless it implements a true LoRaWAN device, gateway
and network-server architecture. Any separate LoRaWAN or public-discussion service must use
different bands and settings and remain isolated from the field telemetry mesh.

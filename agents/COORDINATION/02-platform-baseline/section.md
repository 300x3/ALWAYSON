# 2. Platform Baseline

## 2.1 Intended Platform Standard

| Area | Architecture requirement |
|---|---|
| Host OS | Kubuntu 26.04 LTS workstation; the selection rationale is in §1 |
| Current CPU/GPU | AMD CPU and EVGA NVIDIA GTX 1080 |
| Future compute | Immersion-cooled server rack and Raspberry Pi edge cluster |
| Container engine | Podman only |
| Container lifecycle | systemd and Podman Quadlet |
| Public website | Static HTML in pCloud Public Folder + Cloudflare domain registration |
| Payments | Provider-hosted checkout and verified payment events; no local card handling; local stablecoin processing |
| Sales and support | Sales API, PostgreSQL, Mastodon integration, OpenClaw, and LM Studio |
| Drone compute | Raspberry Pi 5 with Waveshare SX1262-class LoRa top-hat |
| Drone autopilot | 3DR N1 connected to Raspberry Pi 5 by MAVLink |
| Desktop radios | Two Heltec LoRa 32 V3 (SX1262), distinguished by USB port topology as `/dev/ao-drone-radio` (ttyUSB0, DRONE-RADIO 917 MHz) and `/dev/ao-people-radio` (ttyUSB1, PEOPLE-RADIO 915 MHz) |
| Field protocol | RNS/Reticulum and MeshChatX over raw LoRa unless a true LoRaWAN deployment is selected |
| Mapping | WebODM and supporting services under Podman |
| Mapping storage | `/media/scottw/500GBPHOTOGRAM/` |
| Vehicle simulation | ROS 2 Lyrical, Gazebo Sim 10.5.0, ArduPilot SITL, MAVLink, QGroundControl |
| Fabrication simulation | ROS 2 Lyrical, Gazebo Sim 10.5.0, robot cells, additive manufacturing, storage, kitchen, and logistics models |
| Ledger | Corda core behind a dedicated ledger-ingestion gateway |
| Archive | Local source data, signed manifests, encrypted pCloud replication, private or encrypted IPFS workflow |
| Monitoring | Prometheus-compatible metrics, alerts, health checks, and protected administration access |
| Backup | PostgreSQL/Corda-aware backup, restic or equivalent encrypted backup, and scheduled restore testing |

## 2.2 Platform Baseline

The host baseline this design assumes. This is the requirement; the measured values for the
running host are in §19.1, and where the two differ §19.1 is the fact.

| Area | Baseline |
|---|---|
| Kernel | Ubuntu LTS kernel |
| Podman | Rootless for every workload (§13.1, §13.2) |
| Podman networks | **Fourteen** `ao-*` networks, all registered in `config/platform/network-cidrs.yaml`, which is the only authoritative list. **Eleven** are `Internal=true`: the ten workload domains `ao-admin`, `ao-data`, `ao-fabrication`, `ao-field`, `ao-ledger-core`, `ao-ledger-ingest`, `ao-mapping`, `ao-payment`, `ao-sim-fabrication`, `ao-sim-vehicle`, plus `ao-html-window`. **Three** are deliberately `Internal=false`: `ao-sales` for ActivityPub delivery, `ao-reporting-egress` for Grafana and Metabase, and `ao-build-update` for software acquisition |
| GPU | EVGA NVIDIA GTX 1080 |
| NVIDIA driver | Pinned, recorded in the version matrix |
| NVIDIA integration | CDI devices registered, including `nvidia.com/gpu=0`. The authoritative spec is `/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`. `/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml` is not a source of truth and is regenerated or removed at each driver change. Only the authoritative spec contributes devices |
| Simulation stack | ROS 2 Lyrical at `/opt/ros/lyrical`; Gazebo Sim 10.5.0 |
| Host PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL 18, loopback-only |
| Host Redis | Redis 8, loopback-only |
